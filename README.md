# 🧠 **Project Title: UniMem AI**

**Tagline:** *Empowering AI Agents with Long-Term, Multi-Modal Memory — Built on NVIDIA NIM + AWS*

---

## 🚩 **Overview**

**UniMem AI** is a multi-modal **memory engine** that transforms your everyday experiences — text, voice, images, and documents — into an evolving, structured stream of knowledge.
By organizing these “memory units” in a semantic graph, it provides **AI agents with long-term recall and reasoning capabilities**, enabling them to understand not only *what* you said, but *when*, *why*, and *in what context*.

Our vision: to bridge human-like memory and AI cognition through a unified system that can *remember, relate, and reason* over time — powered by **NVIDIA NIM** and **AWS infrastructure**.

## 💡 **Problem**

Most AI assistants today have **short-term memory** — they forget prior interactions, lose context, and can’t build upon previous experiences.
Humans, by contrast, continuously integrate information from **multiple modalities** (speech, images, text, meetings).
This creates a cognitive gap between human memory and AI reasoning.

### Challenges we address

* Fragmented data across formats and platforms
* Lack of persistent, contextual AI memory
* Inefficient retrieval and reasoning over accumulated knowledge

---

## 🚀 **Solution**

**UniMem AI** continuously collects and organizes multi-modal inputs into a **unified “memory stream”**, stored as structured **memory cells** with semantic metadata.

Each memory cell encodes:

* Content embeddings (text, image, audio transcripts)
* Context (timestamp, source, relational links)
* Summaries and topics for fast retrieval

During conversations or reasoning tasks, the **AI Agent** retrieves and reasons over related memory clusters using **NVIDIA NIM microservices**, allowing it to:

* Recall past events and visual cues
* Draw inferences based on long-term context
* Adapt dynamically through continuous learning

This transforms an agent from a reactive chatbot into a **cognitive, context-aware system** capable of reasoning over its own history.
